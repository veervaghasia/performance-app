## Testing APIs with Postman

You can test the applicationâ€™s endpoints using Postman. Follow these steps:

1. **Import Postman Collection**:
    - Open Postman.
    - Click on **Import** and upload the provided `PerformanceAppAPI.postman_collection.json` file.
    - The collection will appear in the sidebar.

2. **Set Up Environment**:
    - Go to **Environments** in Postman.
    - Create a new environment with the variable `base_url` set to `http://localhost:9090`.

3. **Run Endpoints**:
    - Expand the imported collection.
    - Select any endpoint, modify request parameters if needed, and click **Send**.
    - Use the **Collection Runner** in Postman to execute multiple API requests at once and validate responses.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Maven Build Issues**:
    - Ensure `MAVEN_OPTS` is configured for sufficient heap space:
      ```bash
      export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Xms512m"
      ```

2. **Port Already in Use**:
    - Stop any other application running on port `9090` or change the port in `application.properties`:
      ```properties
      server.port=9091
      ```

3. **Database Connection Errors**:
    - Ensure that the H2 database console is reachable, and the application has been started properly.
